# Code Quiz Homework 4

The requirements for this homework was to create a Code Quiz without a starter code provided.

** The working solution can be found here:
https://jdroyko.github.io/codeQuiz/ **

Started by using the code from Activity 10 of Web API, Speed Reader in order to start utilizing the timer then build the rest of the code from there. 

Every correct answer is 10 points,
every incorrect response takes away 10 seconds.

The User Story is below:

# Screenshots 
This is the start screen when the page loads. It has the required elements of a timer and the ability to view high scores.

I utilized hiding and showing the divs in various places to manipulate the screen in the CSS function then calling the divs in JavaScript.

In JavaScript I hide and show the divs as required for what is going on in the page as an example:
