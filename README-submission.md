# Task

The requirements for this homework was to create a Code Quiz without a starter code provided.

**The working solution can be found here:
https://jdroyko.github.io/codeQuiz/**

Started by using the code from Activity 10 of Web API, Speed Reader in order to start utilizing the timer then build the rest of the code from there. 

The User Story is below:
